    "> A variable is an entry that basically serves as a placeholder for objects, but referencing links the object to the variable. Variables do not have to be initialized because they are placeholders and have no inherent value. Python automatically detects object types and initializes them, although some customization can be performed using functions like str and int. Initialized objects can be linked to variables.  "
