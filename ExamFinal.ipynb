    "Note that these exam questions are designed to deepen your understanding of Python language and data science topics. I encourage you to try to think about the answers first and formulate how you would formulate them, before you cross-check and complete them by looking up your notes or elsewhere. This is also similar to how we approach scientific writing about theoretical topics, for example for the introduction of a report or scientific paper. First we note down down our thoughts to include what we understand is important and to draft a sketch on a topic, then we reflect our draft by revising the literature, and then we use both to formulate our statements more precise. \n",
